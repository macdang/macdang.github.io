## 中文诗歌

### 春望

> 国破山河在，城春草木深。  
> 感时花溅泪，恨别鸟惊心。  
> 烽火连三月，家书抵万金。  
> 白头搔更短，浑欲不胜簪。  
> ——杜甫

## English Poems

### The Road Not Taken

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
> And sorry I could not travel both  
> And be one traveler, long I stood  
> And looked down one as far as I could  
> To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

> Then took the other, as just as fair,  
> And having perhaps the better claim,  
> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
> Though as for that the passing there  
> Had worn them really about the same,  
>  
> ——Robert Frost
